# Leslie255's Bytecode Virtual Machine

I made this VM so I can submit my C coursework in the form of a bunch of bytecode and a `machine.h` file.
It is not made as a "useful" bytecode VM hence some of the design choices.

See `manual.md` for design of the Bytecode VM.

Currently work in progress (almost finished!), an assembler is planned but it won't be written in C.
